CSS units https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp
CSS has several different units for expressing a length.

Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc.

Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc.

Absolute Lengths
The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.

Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. However, they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.
cm	centimeters
mm	millimeters
in	inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
px *	pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
pt	points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
pc	picas (1pc = 12 pt)



Relative Lengths
Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different rendering medium.


em	Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)	
ex	Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used)	
ch	Relative to the width of the "0" (zero)	
rem	Relative to font-size of the root element	
vw	Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*	
vh	Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*	
vmin	Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension	
vmax	Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension	
%	Relative to the parent element
